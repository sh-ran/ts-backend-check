### Basic Usage

The CLI provides a simple interface to check TypeScript types against backend models:

```bash
# Show help and available commands:
ts-backend-check --help

# Check a TypeScript type against a backend model:
ts-backend-check -bmf <backend-model-file> -tsf <typescript-file>

# Environment setup [`⇧`](#contents)

1. First and foremost, please see the suggested IDE setup in the dropdown below to make sure that your editor is ready for development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> <details><summary>Suggested IDE setup</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> VS Code
>
> Install the following extensions:
>
> - [charliermarsh.ruff](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff)
> - [streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
>
> </p>
> </details>

2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [ts-backend-check repo](https://github.com/activist-org/ts-backend-check), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/ts-backend-check.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) 🔑

> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ts-backend-check.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd ts-backend-check
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/activist-org/ts-backend-check.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (ts-backend-check repository)

3. Create a virtual environment, activate it and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Unix or MacOS:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Windows:
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat

   # After activating venv:
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

   # To install the CLI for local development:
   pip install -e .
   ```

You're now ready to work on `ts-backend-check`!
